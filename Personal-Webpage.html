        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Hey! <b>I am Aniket Krish Das, a 2nd year CSE student at KIIT</b>. Very passionate about 
            story telling via any medium, I hope to merge my interest in Technology with my love for art, and enter the field of
            game development or game design. It also happens to coincide with my hobby of playing games!
            I am a fast and enthusiastic learner, team player, love being thrown into challenging environments, and take 
            writing clean, easily understandable code very seriously.
        </p>

        <h3>Home Town</h3>
        <p>
            Though I was born in Bhubaneswar (same city as KIIT &#128512;), I spent most of my life growing up in Canada. There 
            I was exposed to many different hobbies, which I to this day still pursue. In fact, I started coding 
            when I was in grade 6, because my school in Canada conducted an event for Hour of Code! I hope to go back someday, 
            maybe for my higher studies or even to work and settle down.
        </p>
        
        <h3>My Parents</h3>
        <p>
            My dad, a chemical engineer, and my mom, a primary school teacher, have both supported me immensely with regards to 
            my aspirations and hobbies. Without them I doubt I would be where I am now.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>
            I have many different hobbies, a few of them being:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Playing football and basketball</li>
            <li>Playing the guitar and writing music with my band</li>
            <li>Watching movies, and writing my own screenplays for short films</li>
            <li>Last but not least, playing video games.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>My Aim</h3>
        <p>
            As I mentioned in the introduction, I would am aspiring to become a game developer or game designer, 
            preferably being part of the creative design aspects of the development process. I love playing games, and if 
            I can help make games that other people can play and enjoy, then I would be quite happy with that!
